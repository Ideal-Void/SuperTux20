# Hi, I'm Tux

I like to program in my spare time. I'm actually part of a game development team too, [Weaververse Entertainment](https://github.com/Weaververse-Entertainment)

## Here are some programming languages I know

|Node.js|Python|Bash|Web|
|----|------|----------|------------------|
![JavaScript](src/js.png) 16.9.1 | ![Python](src/py.png) 3.9.5 | ![Bash](src/bash.png) 5.0.17 | ![HTML](src/html.png) 5

Check out the [Pengaelic Bot](https://github.com/SuperTux20/Pengaelic-Bot), I've been working on it for ages, but I haven't done much with it lately because I don't have time.

Hope you enjoy looking through my scattered mind portrayed through my broken lines of code lol

Check out [my Carrd](https://supertux20.carrd.co) for more info that I don't want to bother with retyping here.
