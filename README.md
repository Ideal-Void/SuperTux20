### Hi, I'm Tux.

I like to program in my spare time. I'm actually part of a game development team too, [Weaververse Entertainment](https://github.com/Weaververse-Entertainment)

Check out the [Pengaelic Bot](https://github.com/SuperTux20/Pengaelic-Bot), I've been working on it for ages, but I haven't done much with it lately because I don't have time.

A very small few of you reading this README might know me through [Hy](https://github.com/Hyperfresh), and I just want to make clear that while yes, we do maintain credit between each other's work, we mutually agreed to no longer be associated with each other ~~well, it was more like a burned bridge over a disagreement blown way out of proportion, but the effect is the same in the end~~.

Anyways, hope you enjoy looking through my scattered mind portrayed through my broken lines of code.

Check out [my Carrd](https://supertux20.carrd.co) for more info that I don't want to bother with retyping here.
